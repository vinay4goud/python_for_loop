# for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x) 
  
 # output
 
 apple
banana
cherry


#  Looping Through a String
# Even strings are iterable objects, they contain a sequence of characters:

for x in "banana":
  print(x)
  
 # output
 
b
a
n
a
n
a


#  The break Statement
# With the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x) 
  if x == "banana":
    break
    
 #output
 apple
banana

# Exit the loop when x is "banana", but this time the break comes before the print:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    break
  print(x) 
  
 # output 
 
 apple
 
 
 #  The continue Statement
 #  With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration of the loop, and continue with the next:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    continue
  print(x)   
  
  # output 
  
  apple
cherry


# The range() Function

# To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function,
# The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.

for x in range(6):
  print(x) 
# output 

0
1
2
3
4
5


# The range() function defaults to 0 as a starting value, however it is possible to specify the starting value by adding a parameter: range(2, 6), which means values from 2 to 6 (but not including 6):

for x in range (2,6):
  priunt (x)
  
# output 
2
3
4
5

#  Else in For Loop

# The else keyword in a for loop specifies a block of code to be executed when the loop is finished:

for x in range(6):
  print(x)
else:
  print("Finally finished!")


# Nested Loops
# A nested loop is a loop inside a loop.

# The "inner loop" will be executed one time for each iteration of the "outer loop":

adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for x in adj:
  for y in fruits:
    print(x, y)
    
# output 

red apple
red banana
red cherry
big apple
big banana
big cherry
tasty apple
tasty banana
tasty cherry
